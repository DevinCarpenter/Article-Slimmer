Article Slimmer is an app that lets the user paste in a link to an article,
and with the press of a button - slim it down!

  * Google Material design
  * Option for unlimited requests
  * Saved article summaries

### Other Notes
  

The app uses an api called SMMRY (I'm not the author) that uses an algorithm
to sort through strings of words in an article in order to rank the sentence
importance and sift through sentences that are more information and less bloat.

Article Slimmer is currently using the free version of the SMMRY API, and so
is limited to 100 article summaries per day. Until an account system is created,
users will be limited to however many requests are left within the app.

Big shout out and thanks to the authors of SMMRY and smmry.com for making this
available to developers!
